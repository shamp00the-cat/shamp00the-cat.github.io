    <h2>Personal Creative Statement:</h2>

    <p>
      I've always been very interested in film and visual arts, and where they
      meet. My favorite director is David Lynch; I find his avant-garde style of
      film making very inspiring. I love a movie or show that you could pause at
      any moment, and the image is so beautiful you could justifyably print and
      frame it. David Lynch combines beautiful imagery and composition with
      amazing original soundtracks that create a cinematic world that hypnotizes
      viewers, like a dream. I would love to learn the basic skills of film
      making such as camera skills and photo/video editing, to see if there's
      anything I could express through that medium. I feel that filmmaking gives
      the ultimate creative outlet as it combines writing, story telling, visual
      art and music. I am also an aspiring web developer, and I hope to grow my
      basic web design skills in this class.
