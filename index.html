    <h2>Personal Creative Statement:</h2>
    <h3>WHO I AM:</h3>
     <p>
    I'm an aspiring web designer. I have experience with, but am always learning more about:
    software engineering, web development, UI/UX design, and digital media production. I bring insight
    and experience from both the visual side of design and the more technical programming aspects of 
    development for a nuanced, holistic approach. I love designing, editing, and coding on my free time.
    I also love playing CTF's and dabbling in penetration testing. I am passionate about all things web, 
    code, design, and media.
        </p>
    <h3>WHERE I DRAW INSPIRATION:</h3>
    <p>
  I've always been very interested in film and visual arts, and where they
  meet. My favorite director is David Lynch; I find his avant-garde style of
  film making very inspiring. I'm inspired by films/shows that you could pause at
  any moment, and the image is so beautiful you could justifyably print and
  frame it. David Lynch combines beautiful imagery and composition with
  amazing original soundtracks that create a cinematic world that hypnotizes
  viewers and suck them into the experience. I would love to build on my basic 
  videography and photo/video editing skills, to see if there's
  anything I could express through that medium. I feel that filmmaking gives
  the ultimate creative outlet as it combines writing, story telling, visual
  art and music.
