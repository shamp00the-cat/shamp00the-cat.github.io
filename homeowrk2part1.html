    <h3>Reflection:</h3>
    <p>
      I went into this assignment admittedly confused about depth of field, and
      how to acheive it. I knew what kind of pictures I wanted to use the effect
      on, but I had a hard time understanding how to successfully maneuver the
      camera. I grow to have more and more respect for photographers the more I
      learn about cameras. Something that seems so accessible and intuitive can
      quickly become more complex and difficult that you'd imagined! That being
      said, I'm very drawn to portals as subject matter in film. Hallways,
      doorways, stairwells are all very interesting to me. Capturing these while
      there are people moving through them was really fun, and a concept I plan
      to build on as time goes on. I think it could be worth it to use shallow
      or deep depth of field depending on what kind of feeling you are trying to
      evoke. Something I didn't fully grasp until after I used the camera and
      came back to lab was how to adjust the light. That is something I need to
      work on.
