I'm a student studying Digital Media and Computer Science at CUNY Hunter College. For one of my classes we have to make a portfolio site to upload all of our assignments to, rather than turning them in on the school site. I decided to take this opportunity to stylize my site and practice CSS and HTML. I coded this site from scratch, by myself.
