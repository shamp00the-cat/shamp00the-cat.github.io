    <h3>Reflection:</h3>
    <p>
      I took this picture of my apartment rooftop one night a while back. It was
      at dusk, after sunset. The warm bright colors of sunset had dissipated but
      it wasn't completely dark yet. I have loved this picture on its own for a
      while now so I was excited to get to use it for something! I love the open
      door and the warm light leaking out from inside.

      After cropping the photo to make it the required size of the assignment,
      it definitely changed the image and how it translated into an
      illustration. I decided to embrace the difficulties I faced trying to make
      what I had initially imagined and instead lean into the abstract geometric
      style. The shapes are sort of floating in front of the sky which I think
      gives a feeling that one sometimes feels on a rooftop with such a view. I
      had a lot of fun with this, and it taught me a lot about Adobe
      Illustrator.
