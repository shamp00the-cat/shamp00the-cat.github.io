    <h1>Reading Reflections</h1>

    <h2>Reflection #1: In Plato's Cave, from On Photography by Susan Sontag</h2>
    <p>
      I really liked how Sontag said "To collect photographs is to collect the
      world"....."Photographed images do not seem to be statements about the
      world so much as pieces of it, miniatures of reality that anyone can make
      or acquire." It is eye opening also, to consider that all of what we know,
      visually, of the past is known through photographs, as all else is truly
      merely an interpretation. That being said, you can still take a misleading
      photograph. It's very true that "photography is not practiced by most
      people as an art". I think this only becomes more true as time goes on,
      with smart phones and the increasing popularity of social media. I agree
      that "needing to have reality confirmed and experience enhanced through
      photographs is an aesthetic consumerism to which everyone is now
      addicted." Yet, I still find them necessary to modern society.

      Prior to this class, I used photography and image making in a variety of
      ways. There were times that I used it as an artistic medium, with my 35mm
      camera, and put a lot of thought behind the composition, colors, etc. That
      being said, I have definitley more often over the years used photographs
      and images unseriously over social media applications, mostly in joking
      manners, and also to record fun times. So far in this class, though, I
      have returned to a more thoughtful mindset when it comes to image making
      and photography. I'm happy about that and excited to see what comes of it.

      I think in a way there is no way to take a photo that doesn't visually
      represent in some way the notions of our world at this moment. Of course,
      there is a way to thoughtfully do so and a way to thoughtlessly do so. I
      think memes and most social media content in general are examples of how
      to thoughtlessly do that. Ways to more thoughtfully do so would be
      documentary making, reporting, interviews, and photography of meaningful
      moments. I have always loved portraits as a means of this, so personally I
      would choose to represent visually the notions of our world at this moment
      by taking portraits of people, families, and groups, as well as video
      interviews and documentary style videos.

      Reflection #2: My Stolen Future - Heela, from Motherhood in Crisis - Al
      Jazeera
    </h2>
    <p>I chose to read and reflect on Motherhood in Crisis.</p>
    <p>
      When I first started reading about Heela and what happens to so many
      schoolgirls in Sierra Leone my heart sank. It’s so terrible to think about
      a girl being in school with her whole life ahead of her, just to have all
      her hopes and dreams being crushed by such a traumatizing event as sexual
      assault. The trauma of the assault alone is hard enough for a developing
      young person, but then the barrier to access of healthcare adding the
      burden of carrying out the pregnancy is a heartbreaking tragedy. A halt in
      their progression towards their goals. You could of course say that now
      their life is just different: as a mother rather than a schoolgirl. Of
      course, they’ll come to love the child, who isn’t at fault for what
      happened. But that doesn’t change the fact that it should have been their
      choice to make.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the story progressed, I was relieved when I read that Heela was given
      the opportunity to be taken care of at the Rainbo Centre. I think it’s
      great that the facility is there to bring girls who are facing the same
      hardships together, and make sure they are cared for. The story was an
      emotional rollercoaster, from the horrible things that took place to the
      moments of relief, but more than anything I’m left wishing that Heela and
      the other girls who face this didn’t have to go through what they did.
      This story leaves you feeling conflicted, because it’s heartwarming to
      know that the Rainbo Centre is doing the immensely important work of
      helping these girls. Yet, you are still left heartbroken that the issue
      stands in the first place. I wish more than anything that young girls
      didn't have to face the things they do around the world, and that they
      weren't the ones left with the burden when the father abandons them. My
      heart goes out to Heela and every other person who ever goes through such
      a horrible incident as this.
