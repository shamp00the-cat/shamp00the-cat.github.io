    <h3>Reflection:</h3>
    <p>
      Once again, as I hope you can see, I'm playing with how to make media
      evoke an eery feeling. There are subject matters, such as a doorway that
      you can't see past, which subconsiously read as somewhat dangerous. Here,
      I wanted to see what kinds of lighting and colors evoke the same feeling.
      I feel like the more texture there is to the photo, the more dirty it
      appears, and the harder it is to relax when looking at it. Colors like
      green, to me, can be sickly or dirty, while red can be threatening. There
      isn't a monster or anything in these photos; in real life I see these
      places everyday and they are very neutral, comfortable even. Yet, when
      shot a ceratin way and manipulated another, they can become anxiety
      inducing in the same way that a shaking camera in a film can affect the
      viewer.
