    <h3>Reflection:</h3>
    <p>
      I was drawn to these stairs compositionally because I found the idea of of
      being below the subject I was shooting interesting. I also found the lines
      and shape of the hallway/stairs compositionally intruiging. I then asked
      my classmate to pose for me on the stairs, in order to have a more organic
      subject amidst the harsh lines of the stairway.

      I had a lot of fun trying to think on my feet to figure out what to
      photograph this week. I had never spent time on Photoshop before this
      class. I found it challenging, yet rewarding. I am hopeful that I will be
      able to use this skill in the future for my personal projects as well as
      professional opportunties.
