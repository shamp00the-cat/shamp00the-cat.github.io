    <h3>Reflection:</h3>
    <p>
      I first gravitated towards this corner because I saw the padlock on the
      dented door visually interesting. I then pulled away and used the doorway
      to create lines and shapes that cut across the image and represent a
      portal to an unseen area. I made the final version of this photo "creepy",
      because it compositionally reminded me of a horror movie still. Something
      about the fact that you can't see what is around the bend past the doorway
      is eery.

      I had a lot of fun trying to think on my feet to figure out what to
      photograph this week. I had never spent time on Photoshop before this
      class. I found it challenging, yet rewarding. I am hopeful that I will be
      able to use this skill in the future for my personal projects as well as
      professional opportunties. Lastly, writing my creative statement put
      things into perspective for me in terms of my goals and who I am as a
      creative person at this point in life.
